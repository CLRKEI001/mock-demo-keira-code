-- Offline screener: licences + offline fields on puzzlebox_screenings
-- Safe to run on production: creates one new table and adds four new
-- columns. No existing rows or columns are changed or removed.

-- 1. One row per offline download (one licence per device per download)
create table public.offline_licences (
  id              uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),

    -- The educator who downloaded the screener. "on delete cascade" means
  -- that if the user is deleted, their licences are deleted too, so no
  -- orphan licences are left behind.
  user_id         text not null references public.users(id) on delete cascade,

   -- The examiner's name, shown on the offline screener
  examiner        text,                         -- name shown in the watermark

  -- A random ID the browser generates, so each device is tracked separately
  device_id       text not null,                -- random ID the browser generates

    -- When the licence was issued, and when it stops working (7 days later).
  issued_at       timestamptz not null default now(),

    -- An admin sets this to true to cancel a licence (lost device, staff left).
  -- The device wipes itself the next time it syncs.

  expires_at      timestamptz not null,
  revoked         boolean not null default false,  -- admin sets true to cancel (lost device etc.)
  revoked_at      timestamptz,

    -- The last time this device uploaded its results.
  last_synced_at  timestamptz
);


-- Makes looking up a user's licences fast.
create index offline_licences_user_id_idx on public.offline_licences (user_id);

-- Admins can see, change and cancel any licence.

alter table public.offline_licences enable row level security;

-- Admins can see and cancel any licence
create policy offline_licences_admin on public.offline_licences
  for all to anon, authenticated
  using (app.is_admin()) with check (app.is_admin());

-- Educators can only read their own licences. They cannot create or edit
-- them: only the issue-offline-package Edge Function does that.
create policy offline_licences_read_own on public.offline_licences
  for select to anon, authenticated
  using (user_id = app.uid());

-- 2. Mark screenings that were captured offline.
--    offline_session_id is unique, so the same offline result can never be
--    saved twice, even if an upload is retried after a dropped connection.
alter table public.puzzlebox_screenings
  add column is_offline          boolean not null default false,
  add column licence_id          uuid references public.offline_licences(id) on delete set null,
  add column captured_at         timestamptz,

    -- A unique ID for each offline result. Because it is "unique", the same
  -- result can never be saved twice, even if an upload is retried after a
  -- dropped connection
  add column offline_session_id  uuid unique;
