//
// PuzzleBox Screener — content, Version 1.0
//
// This mirrors the paper "PuzzleBox Screener Record Book" item-for-item.
// It is deliberately NOT hard-coded into the screening components — every
// component that renders the screener (PuzzleBoxScreener.js) reads its
// sections/questions from a content object like this one, so that:
//
//   1. In Phase 5 (Admin Content Management) this same shape can be loaded
//      from Supabase tables (screener_versions / screener_sections /
//      screener_questions) instead of this file, with zero changes to the
//      screening UI.
//   2. Historical screenings can keep pointing at "version: 1.0" even after
//      an admin publishes 1.1, because each completed screening stores a
//      snapshot of the content version it was taken against
//      (see PuzzleBoxScreener.js — `content_version` + `content_snapshot`).
//
// IMPORTANT — scoring rules that are still being finalised by the
// psychologists are intentionally left as `null` / `needsConfirmation: true`
// rather than guessed. Per the dev requirements doc: "the system should not
// automatically make assumptions about any scoring rules that are still
// being finalised by the psychologists." The clearest example is the
// puzzle (item 1) score when a child goes over the 10-minute limit — the
// age-based time table below only covers *completed* attempts, so
// `overTimeScoreRule: null` until the psychologists confirm what an
// incomplete/over-time attempt should score.
//
// Attribution note: this content is transcribed from "The Puzzle Project —
// PuzzleBox Screener Record Book", which the record book itself credits in
// part to Dr R. Marais & Dr J. Jansen (2025). It's reproduced here only
// because digitising it *is* this project's brief, in direct collaboration
// with the psychologists who authored it — treat any changes to wording or
// scoring as something that needs their sign-off, same as the paper form.

//   "binary"     — 0 = Fail, 1 = Pass
//   "scale3"     — 0 = Fail, 1 = Pass, 2 = Passed Confidently (manual)
//   "age_table"  — teacher enters a raw value (time in seconds, or a count
//                  of correctly-identified items); the score (0/1/2) is
//                  looked up from the age-based table below. The raw value
//                  is always stored alongside the derived score.
//   "checklist"  — a set of sub-items the teacher ticks off; the *count*
//                  ticked feeds an age_table lookup (used for items 9 & 10).
