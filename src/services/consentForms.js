// consentForms.js
//
// Shared upload + AI verification + save flow for consent forms, used by
// both ChildrenTable.js (Student Records' consent panel) and
// TeacherHome.js (the "Add New Student" flow, so a form can be attached
// right when a child is created). Keeping this in one place means there's
// exactly one path that writes consent_verified — never two components
// quietly disagreeing about what counts as "verified".
//
// The actual reading of the form (does it look filled in, even if
// handwritten) is meant to happen server-side in a "validate-consent-form"
// Edge Function that calls an AI vision model. NOTE: that function is not in
// supabase/functions in this repo. Until it is deployed every upload comes
// back "could not verify" and goes to an admin for manual review. When it is
// added it should use a Gemini key secret (like translator-chat, which reads
// Puzzle_Play_Translator_Gemini_API_Key) — NOT ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

// valid:false with notes explaining why, since "the AI check itself broke"
// should still let the teacher see what was uploaded and retry, rather
// than losing the file.
